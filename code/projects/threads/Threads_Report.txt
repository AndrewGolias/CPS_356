Matrix Multiplication Project using Java Threads

---------------------------------------------------

Matrix.java has a main method with simple 2x2 matrices
  to verify the implementation of matrix multiplication
  with threads.

The performance results are output after multiplyBy()
  and multiplyByThreads() are run on the large matrices
  (1000's of rows & columns)

Performance Results (From testing):
 - multiplyBy(): 28.921 seconds
 - multiplyByThreads(): 3.477 seconds

These results are valid for the logic of this program,
  that running threads in parallel completes computation
  in less time for larger processes
